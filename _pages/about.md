I am a PhD student in the Boeva Lab at ETH Zürich. Previously, I worked as a research intern at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) on optimization problems in radiation therapy and the German Climate Computing Center (DKRZ) developing tools for climate simulations. I hold a Master's degree in Data Science from ETH Zürich and Bachelor degrees in Mathematics and International Economics from the University of Tübingen. My research interests lie at the intersection of single cell foundation models, representation learning, and cancer biology.
